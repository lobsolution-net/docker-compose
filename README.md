I started this project because I wanted to apply all my 20+ years of software development in designing the best product I could.
Everytime I learn a new technology, which can be useful for this, I just use it, even if I have to rewrite a lot of code.
Right now the source code is still not open, but it will probably be soon.

I hope you enjoy it!
